|-|-|
|1| <ul><li>Learned the basics of microbit programming by testing different basic features such as using the LEDs and playing different sounds <li>Microbit controllers have easy-to use bluetooh and UART capabilities, but we are not sure if we will be using them <li>A convenient feature of the microbit is its ability to communicate with other microbits over radio|
|2| <ul><li>Microbits may have some lag in terms of their radio communication, so as we begin to implement functionality, we will see if this becomes an issue|
|3| N/A (mainly experimented with new code, nothing new learned)|
